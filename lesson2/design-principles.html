        <h2> White Space and Clean Design </h2> 
        <img src="lesson2/images/arium-site" alt='screenshot of arium botanical home page. dispays their name, a photo of someone holding a plant' id='white-space-design' >
        <p>Arium Botanical</p> 
        <link href='https://ariumbotanicals.com/' rel='https://ariumbotanicals.com/'>
        <p> This site is a good example of White space and clean design. They utilize the white space and make the focus the content they provide and their products. No nonsense. My kind of website.  </p>       
        
        
        <h2>Proximity</h2>
        <img src="#" alt='Screenshot of Gretta Thunberg home page. a green background with a white figure on a hill in front of the words "Greta Thunberg" in large font.' id='Proximity' >
        <p>Greta Thurnberg</p> 
        <link href='https://theyearofgreta.com/' rel='https://theyearofgreta.com/'>
        <p> I like how this site is quite minimal and does not have things in conventional places but uses the Principle of Proximity (and visual Hierarchy) to show viewers whats important. Especially using the girls name behind the figure helps your brain make the the connection who that figure is compared to if it did not have the wording behind it.  </p>


        <h2>Contrast </h2>

        <p>Yamaha Motorsports was one of the websites I found that used a black background and contrasting colors for the wording. As well as the contrast of the light blue swirl in the photo, it uses contrast in that compostion to emphasize their message.  </p>
